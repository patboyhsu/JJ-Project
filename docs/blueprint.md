# **App Name**: MoodTune Web App

## Core Features:

- Weather Data Fetching: Automatically retrieve and display the current and weekly weather forecast for the user's location using a weather API.
- User Preference Settings: Allow users to set their gender and personalize their preferences via selectable personality tags (e.g., optimistic, calm, passionate, etc.).
- Music Playlist Recommendation: Recommend music playlists based on weather conditions, user-defined mood derived from weather forecast (e.g., sunny=happy, rainy=melancholy), gender, and personality preferences. An LLM may be used as a tool, in deciding whether a particular song is suitable for the user.
- Embedded Music Player: Embed a music player (e.g., YouTube or Spotify IFrame Player API) to play the recommended music playlists.
- Dynamic Background Image: Change the page background image automatically based on the recommended music scenario (weather, gender, personality).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D1B0FF) to evoke tranquility and creativity, aligning with the immersive music experience.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop, ensuring the content remains the focal point.
- Accent color: Muted mauve (#BC8F8F) for interactive elements, offering a subtle contrast that complements the overall calming theme.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif font, to provide an elegant and intellectual feel for headlines and body text.
- Simple and clean icons that represent weather conditions and user preferences.  Use a consistent style throughout the app.
- Single-page application layout for smooth transitions and a more app-like experience. Keep the design minimal and focused on the music and background visuals.
- Use subtle animations for background image transitions and playlist changes to enhance the user experience.
